## Problem Statement
There is no one-stop mobile application for students/(new) developers to guide them to get started or a platform to showcase their skills. Current solutions lack easy to use interface where one can query their coding problems __on the go__.
## Description
### Persona
Ze is a student who wants to get started with programming and doesn't have a laptop/PC. Since there are plenty of sources/applications, Ze is confused about which will be appropriate for newbies. Our mobile application provides basic programs and a platform for developers/students to showcase their skills, get their queries dealt with, and test their code with an editor in the app. It helps Ze to self-learn as well as assist others once Ze masters Ze's skills.
